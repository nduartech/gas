# AGENT Guidelines for gas
- Use Bun; install deps with `bun install` at repo root.
- Build the library with `bun run build` (includes `build:types`).
- Run all tests with `bun test` from the project root.
- Run a single test file with `bun test test/parser.test.ts` (adjust path as needed).
- For the sample app: `cd test/apps/sample-app && bun install && bun run build`.
- CI mirrors these steps: install, `bun test`, then `bun run build`.
- No dedicated linter is configured; do not introduce new tooling without discussion.
- Match existing formatting: 2-space indentation, semicolons, double-quoted strings.
- Use ES modules (`import`/`export`) with named imports where possible.
- Keep TypeScript types explicit; avoid `any` and prefer narrow, descriptive interfaces.
- Reuse existing types from `src/types.ts` and nearby modules before adding new ones.
- Follow existing naming: PascalCase for types/components, camelCase for variables/functions.
- Keep functions small and focused; extract helpers in the same module before creating new files.
- Preserve error-handling patterns: throw `Error`/custom errors with clear, actionable messages.
- When catching errors, include contextual information (file, JSX snippet, or position) in messages.
- Prefer pure, deterministic helpers; avoid hidden global state beyond documented caches/context.
- Keep imports ordered: standard library/Node, third-party, then internal `./` modules.
- Do not reformat unrelated code; keep diffs minimal and focused on the task.
- There are currently no Cursor or Copilot rule files; if added, update this document.
